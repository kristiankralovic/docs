## Creating new projects easily

If you want to integrate your software _(Mergado platform app or any other web app)_ with Mergado by allowing your users to create a **new project** in Mergado quickly and easily, we offer you a _"prefill URL"_ which navigates the user's browser to the _"new project wizard"_ page - with provided **URL of the input feed** already filled in:

`https://app.mergado.com/new-project/prefill/?url=<feed_url>`
